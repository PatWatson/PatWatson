Hey I'm Patrick! 

I'm a Silicon Design Engineer at AMD working on software performance verification of memory systems and modelling of GPUs/AI Accelerators. 

I'm a graduate of Queen's University Computer Engineering and I'm interested in software/hardware co-design engineering, AI/ML infrastructure support and solving hard problems with other engineers! 

Always interested in meeting like-minded developers, so feel free to reach out!
