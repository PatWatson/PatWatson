Hey I'm Patrick! 

I'm a Software Engineer at AMD working on the Instinct GPU accelerators used for Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. 

I'm a graduate of Queen's University Computer Engineering and I'm interested in software & hardware engineering, AI/ML, full-stack development, and product design in tech. 

Always interested in meeting like-minded developers, so feel free to reaech out!
